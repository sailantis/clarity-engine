# Changelog

All notable changes to `sailantis/clarity-engine` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`{% for %} … {% else %}`** — a loop may declare a branch that renders when
  the sequence is empty, matching Twig. Works for arrays, mappings and ranges.
  The compiler adds the "did it iterate" flag only when the branch is present,
  so loops without it compile exactly as before.
- **Twig-style operator tests** — `in` / `not in`, `is defined`, `is null`,
  `is empty`, `is iterable`, `is even`, `is odd`, `starts with`, `ends with`,
  `matches`, `divisible by` and `same as`. The `defined`, `null` and `empty`
  tests tolerate an absent left operand and answer instead of throwing.
- **Whitespace control** — `{%- … -%}` (and `{{- … -}}`, `{#- … -#}`) suppress
  the whitespace on the chosen side of a tag.
- **Collection functions** — `range(low, high, step?)`,
  `cycle(values, position)` and `attribute(subject, name, default?)`.
- Compiler tests for the above.

### Changed

- `in` matches a list by value and a mapping by key, mirroring Twig.
- The `loop` variable is no longer documented: it was documented but never
  implemented. Use `{% for key, value in items %}` for the index.

### Fixed

- Documentation: corrected the filter/function call model, object access, and
  removed the documented-but-unimplemented `loop` object.
- Removed a stale docblock reference to a `castToArray()` that no longer exists.
